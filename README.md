# speedylemon
Designed off of https://github.com/killer415tv/gw2_speedometer as a base

The original speedometer is purely designed for Windows (with good reason, as Windows is the target platform for Guild Wars 2). However, as Proton works well and even seems to outperform Windows, making the speedometer cross-platform may be desired.
