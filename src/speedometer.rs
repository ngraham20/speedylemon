    // calculate the speed

    // dst = distance.euclidean(_pos, _lastPos)
    // total_distance = total_distance + dst
    // velocity = dst * 39.3700787 / timer

    // to calculate speed, the position and a timestamp should be saved together.
    // the speed is ds/dt, or the change in distance, divided by the change in time.
